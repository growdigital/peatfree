    <h1>It’s no April Fool – the BIG dirty secret being used in British gardens</h1>

    <h3>New #PeatFreeApril campaign urges gardeners to ditch climate-damaging peat compost for peat-free</h3>

    <ul>
    <li>Peat removal leads to the release of carbon speeding up global warming &amp; climate change.</li>
    <li>Government’s voluntary 2020 target date to phase out peat for amateur growers will be missed.</li>
    <li>Gardeners could help prevent the release of as much as one million tonnes of carbon dioxide every year by switching to peat-free.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>A new month-long, industry-wide campaign has been launched to get more gardeners to go peat free.</p>

    <p>Fed up by the lack of action by the horticultural trade, #PeatFreeApril wants to encourage gardeners to make the all-important but easy switch to peat free and also ask more questions about compost labelling.</p>

    <p>Britain’s gardeners are still using billions of litres of peat compost every year despite clear evidence peat bogs play a crucial role in the battle against climate change. </p>

    <p>Backed by environment and gardening organisations and spearheaded by peat-free gardeners and gardening journalists – #PeatFreeApril will highlight the problem of peat composts and their confusing labelling. </p>

    <p>The eco-campaign will also draw attention to the fact many potted plants are currently grown in peat-based composts, meaning many gardeners are unwittingly perpetuating the trade in peat – and highlight the fact there are plenty of excellent peat-free products that do the job just as well, if not better. </p>

    <p>Peat bogs are amongst the UK’s rarest and most fragile wildlife habitats and store twice as much carbon as all of the earth&#8217;s standing forests, as well as helping to counter the over production of carbon dioxide elsewhere. But, after years of damage, only 20% of peatlands are in good condition and instead of storing carbon are actually releasing greenhouse gases. </p>

    <p>“There was a global clamour against the burning of the Amazon rainforests but not a murmur was heard in favour of protecting peatlands. While peatlands may not look as inspiring as a rainforest, the role they play in helping us fight climate change, protecting against flooding and supporting wildlife is just as important,” says campaign spokesperson Sally Morgan. “Yet it’s almost 10 years since the government set targets to phase out the use of peat by amateur gardeners by 2020 – and this will clearly now not be achieved”.</p>

    <p>Peat forms incredibly slowly, barely a millimetre depth a year, so a thick layer of peat represents thousands of years of stored carbon. UK gardeners use more than two billion litres of peat each year, which represents hundreds of years’ worth of peat growth. The buying choices of gardeners can make a real difference. Make the #PeatFreeApril pledge to go peat-free forever!</p>

    <p>During April 2020, #PeatFreeApril will raise awareness about peatlands and peat-free compost with promotions at garden centres, open dates at peat-free gardens and even opportunities for people to visit peatland reserves and see how conservation benefits wildlife.  </p>

    <p>Chris Collins of Garden Organic says: “It is surely not beyond our gift to find alternative means of growing our garden plants that does not involve the wholesale destruction of one of the planets most important ecosystems. The days are coming to an end when we see our natural home as just being a prop for our own want. It is time that every gardener, be it the one just pottering around in a small urban garden or the large gardening retailers who influence our consumer choices, think very carefully about using peat and address the simple fact we are guests and joint tenants on this planet and we should treat it with the respect it deserves.” </p>

    <li>#PeatFreeApril is an awareness campaign organised by a group of gardeners and garden writers including Mark Binnersley, Sally Morgan, Jake Rayson, Sara Venn, Nic Wilson, Sarah Wilson and Alice Whitehead</li>
    <li>The campaign has the support of <a href="https://www.gardenorganic.org.uk">Garden Organic</a>, <a href="https://www.incredibleedible.org.uk">Incredible Edible</a>, <a href="http://www.iucn-uk-peatlandprogramme.org">IUCN UK Peatlands Programme</a> and the <a href="https://www.soilassociation.org">Soil Association</a> with more NGOs coming onboard in the coming months.</li>
    <li>More than half the peat used by UK gardeners is imported from Ireland and the Baltic States. So not only are gardeners contributing to the loss of important habitats across Europe, there is the added carbon impact of long distance haulage.</li>
    <li>Peat free composts only represent about 17 per cent of the market because very few peat free alternatives are available through retail outlets, and those that are stocked are more expensive than the peat-based composts.</li>
