		<h1>Introducing #PeatFreeApril</h1>
<p>Go peatfree to save peatbogs and combat climate change OR What gardeners can do to help stop climate change.<br> There was a global clamour against the burning of rainforests but not a murmur was heard in favour of protecting peatlands. Peatlands may not look as inspiring as a rainforest but the role they play in helping us battle climate change, protect against flooding and protect wildlife is just as important and every gardener can do something simple to help conserve them:  go peatfree. <br> Peat bogs are amongst the UK’s rarest and most fragile wildlife habitats, home to golden plovers, dragonflies, sundews and more. A pristine peatbog sucks up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and locks up the carbon, helping to counter the over production of carbon dioxide elsewhere. Peat formation is an incredibly slow process, barely a millimetre depth of peat a year, so a thick layer of peat represents thousands of years of stored carbon. So, it’s worrying to learn that UK gardeners use 3 billion litres of peat every year – that the equivalent to 50 years’ worth of peat growth! Peat is a critical tool in our battle against climate change so why is it still being dug up to be used in ready-made composts and sold to amateur gardeners? <br> The use of peat in horticulture is relatively recent. It wasn’t until the 1960s that horticulturalists started to mix it with loam and sand to create a ready-made compost that could be bagged and sold to gardeners. And now, because most of our own peatlands have already been dug up, more than half the peat used by UK gardeners is imported from Ireland and the Baltic States. So not only are gardeners contributing to the loss of important habitats across Europe, there is the added carbon impact of long distance haulage. <br> We have long known about the role of peat in carbon sequestration, so there is absolutely no excuse for its continued use in horticulture. Leading gardeners such as the late Geoff Hamilton raised the issue of peat and its lack of sustainability in the 1990s, but it’s still in use. Monty Don and others have followed his lead as has Kew Gardens and the National Trust, while Garden Organic urges its gardeners to go peatfree. But still the sales of peat-based composts continue to increase. In fact, retail sales account for double the volume of peat used in the professional horticultural trade.  <br> Why are gardeners still using peat? Some claim that there is simply no replacement for peat, that the alternative peatfree options are not as good. However, it’s been proven in trials that there are plenty of excellent peatfree products that do the job just as well if not better than peat.  The real reason for the fact that peatfree composts only represent about 17 per cent of the market is to do with the fact that very few peatfree alternatives are available through retail outlets and those that are stocked are more expensive than the peat-based composts. There is no getting around the fact that peat is dirt cheap and gardeners find it difficult to resist. In addition, the brands behind the peat composts claim that if they didn’t have a peat-based compost on offer, customers would turn to their competitors and they would lose their competitive edge. <br> It’s almost 10 years since the government set targets to phase out the use of peat by amateur gardeners by 2020 and clearly this will not be achieved. Fed up by the lack of action by the horticultural trade, a group of concerned gardeners and writers have got together to run a PeatFreeApril campaign. The buying choices of gardeners can make a real difference, so during April 2020, the campaign will alert gardeners to the problems of peat and encourage them to  make that all-important switch to peatfree to protect the remaining peatbogs around the world and help to combat climate change.  The campaign will look at labelling too, as many gardeners are often unaware of the presence of peat in the garden composts that they buy as you have to look really carefully at the labelling. It will also tackle the issue of potted plants being raised in peat-based composts meaning that many gardeners are unwittingly perpetuating the trade in peat.  <br> During April #peatfree action will be promoted through garden magazines and newspapers, blogs, vlogs, tweets and podcasts to raise awareness about peat, combined with promotions in garden centres, open days at peatfree gardens and even opportunities for people to visit peatland reserves and see how conservation benefits wildlife. <br> We’re all trying to do out bit for the environment and by switching to peatfree, gardeners could help to prevent the release of as much as one million tonnes of carbon dioxide every year. Go #peatfree in April.<br> Quotes<br> “Cheap, usually imported, bags of peat do not reflect the environmental costs to society caused by peat mining and are undercutting the production and supply of peat-free materials. Advances in the development of peat-free horticultural products means that the UK could establish its own long-term viable industry providing sustainable soil conditioners and growing materials for amateur and professional gardeners. Many peat-free composts work as effectively or even better than peat. Much of the material used for peat replacement contributes to recycling, such as green compost, or uses by-products including wood brash and other forestry waste.” IUCN UK Peatland Programme</p>
