<h1>Horticulture industry on notice over peat use in compost</h1>

<p>Campaigners calling for an end to the use of peat in compost have warned that the horticulture industry is now on notice following the Government’s response to a petition demanding a ban on the product.</p>

<p>In commenting on the petition which has attracted over 12,000 signatures, Government department Defra admitted that progress to switch away from peat had “stalled” and that the “voluntary target approach has not made as much progress as hoped.”</p>

<p>Nine years ago, a voluntary target for the phasing out of peat for amateur growers was set for 2020 and professional gardeners by 2030. </p>

<p>Defra said it was “currently developing further measures” to tackle the problem and “encouraged” gardeners to seek out peat alternatives.</p>

<p>It added: “While some key players in the industry have been rising to the challenge, and there have been examples of some good progress to date, discussions since 2016 suggests that progress had stalled and the voluntary target approach has not made as much progress as hoped. We are currently developing further measures and will set out our plans in the forthcoming England Peat Strategy.”</p>

<p>Campaigners at PeatFreeApril, a growing group of professional and amateur gardeners opposed to the use of peat in compost, welcomed Defra’s statement and urged the horticulture industry to show leadership. Sally Morgan of PeatFreeApril said: “A voluntary target for the phasing out of peat by 2020 for amateur gardeners has been a complete failure and this is due to dithering by big players in the horticulture industry which have put commercial considerations above everything else. </p>

<p>“But with growing public awareness about the importance of peatbogs to the climate and nature, we cannot wait another 10 years for peat to be phased out. The gardening sector is now on notice and the switch needs to happen for amateurs and professionals within three years at most. </p>

<p>“Defra needs to take a consistently robust position on this in the England Peat Strategy, which needs to incorporate peat imports from Ireland and elsewhere. We also strongly urge the Government to act objectively in the face of industry lobbying from organisations like the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board and act in the interests of the planet not profit. </p>

<p>“Meanwhile, we encourage forward-thinking garden centres to do the right thing and help their customers choose a compost that is kinder to the planet than peat-based compost and to stop selling plug plants in peat-based compost.”</p>

<p>Peat bogs are amongst the UK’s rarest and most fragile wildlife habitats, home to golden plovers, dragonflies, sundews and more. </p>

<p>A pristine peat bog soaks up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, helping to counter carbon dioxide emissions elsewhere. </p>

<p>Peat formation is an incredibly slow process. Growing at barely a millimetre in depth of peat per year, a thick layer of peat represents thousands of years of stored carbon. </p>

<p>UK gardeners are responsible for 70 per cent of the horticultural peat used in the UK.</p>
