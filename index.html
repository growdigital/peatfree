<h2 id="whatdoyouwantustodo">What do you want us to do?</h2>

<p>Ban the use of peat in gardening and horticulture</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>Buying peat-based compost contributes to the destruction of wildlife habitats by peat mining &amp; the release of vast amounts of carbon dioxide, the main agent of climate breakdown. To tackle climate breakdown &amp; its impact on our natural world, we need to ban the use of peat in gardening &amp; horticulture</p>
